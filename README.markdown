jwm_kicad_symbols_misc
======================

This is a collection of miscellaneous symbols for [KiCad](https://kicad.org). Currently, this is my only custom symbols library, but it's also a holding library before I can break symbols out into separate specialized libraries.

(You might also be interested in my related [misc footprints library](https://github.com/joem/jwm_kicad_footprints_misc.pretty) and [misc 3D models library](https://github.com/joem/jwm_kicad_3dmodels_misc.3dshapes) for KiCad.)

Symbols included in this library:

Symbol name | Description
----------- | -----------
74VHC4046N_LZX | a 74VHC4046N IC, made to look like the ones found in LZX's Cadet schematics
Eurorack_Header_LZX | a Eurorack synth power header, made to look like the ones found in LZX's Cadet schematics
INA3221_Module | an INA3221 module, controlled by I2C
INA3221_Module_NoVPU | an INA3221 module, controlled by I2C, without a VPU pin
LMH1980 | a LMH1980 sync separator IC
LT1251_LZX | a LT1251 IC, made to look like the ones found in LZX's Cadet schematics
SSD1306_I2C_OLED_Module | an SSD1306 I2C OLED module
SW_DPDT_LZX | a DPDT switch, made to look like the ones found in LZX's Cadet schematics
Sync_Header_LZX | a LZX 14-pin sync header, made to look like the ones found in LZX's Cadet schematics


(Yes, so far they're mostly made to look like symbols from LZX's Cadet schematics which were made in Diptrace. As I work on more circuits in the future, I'll be adding more that are not emulating LZX's parts.)

For an easy preview of what these symbols look like, look in the [images](images/) folder.

Please feel free to use these symbols as you'd like in your own projects. If they help you, I'm glad.
